Build a **Simple To-Do List App** in Python for managing tasks. The app should run in the command line and allow users to: 1) Add tasks by entering text, 2) View tasks with their status (e.g., pending or completed), and 3) Mark tasks as done by selecting the corresponding task number. Tasks should be stored in a list with attributes like name and status (done or not). The program should include a menu interface with options for these actions and a loop to keep the app running until the user exits. This lightweight project focuses on functionality and simplicity.
