# 7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

## 7.1 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

Since this is a single-user local application, authentication and authorization are handled through operating system file permissions and access controls.

| Security Layer | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File Access | OS file permissions (600) | Restrict task data access to owner |
| Directory Access | User home directory | Leverage OS user isolation |
| Runtime Access | Single process model | Prevent concurrent access |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Access] --> B{OS Authentication}
    B -->|Authorized| C[File System Access]
    B -->|Unauthorized| D[Access Denied]
    C --> E{File Permissions}
    E -->|600| F[Read/Write Access]
    E -->|Other| G[Permission Denied]
```

## 7.2 DATA SECURITY

### 7.2.1 File Security

| Security Measure | Implementation | Protection Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File Permissions | Owner read/write only | System-level |
| Storage Location | User home directory | OS-protected |
| Backup Files | Same permissions as primary | System-level |
| File Operations | Atomic writes | Application-level |

### 7.2.2 Data Protection

        A[Input Data] --> B[Sanitization]
        B --> C[Validation]
        C --> D[Memory Storage]

    subgraph Security Controls
        F[Permission Check] --> E
        G[Path Validation] --> E
        H[Input Cleaning] --> B
    end
```

### 7.2.3 Memory Security

| Measure | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Memory Clearing | Post-operation cleanup | Prevent data leaks |
| Buffer Management | Fixed-size buffers | Prevent overflows |
| Variable Scope | Minimal exposure | Reduce attack surface |

## 7.3 SECURITY PROTOCOLS

### 7.3.1 File Operation Protocols

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Application
    participant F as File System
    
    U->>A: Request File Access
    A->>A: Validate Permissions
    A->>F: Check File Access
    F-->>A: Confirm Access
    A->>F: Create Backup
    A->>F: Perform Operation
    F-->>A: Operation Result
    A->>A: Clear Memory
    A-->>U: Operation Complete
```

### 7.3.2 Input Validation Protocol

| Input Type | Validation Rule | Security Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task Text | 1-200 chars, alphanumeric + basic punctuation | Prevent injection |
| Menu Selection | Integer 1-4 | Prevent buffer overflow |
| File Paths | Restricted to user directory | Prevent path traversal |
| Task Numbers | Positive integers within list range | Prevent index attacks |

### 7.3.3 Error Handling Security

| Error Type | Handling Protocol | Security Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File Access | Generic error messages | Hide system details |
| Input Validation | Sanitized feedback | Prevent information disclosure |
| System Errors | Logged locally | Audit trail |
| Recovery | Use backup files | Data protection |

### 7.3.4 Security Monitoring

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Security Events
        A[File Access] --> E[Event Log]
        B[Input Validation] --> E
        C[Permission Checks] --> E
        D[Error Conditions] --> E
    end
    
    subgraph Monitoring
        E --> F[Local Log File]
        F --> G[Size Rotation]
        F --> H[Permission Check]
    end
```

### 7.3.5 Security Configuration

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File Mode | 0600 | Owner-only access |
| Log Level | ERROR | Minimal disclosure |
| Max Log Size | 1MB | Prevent disk filling |
| Input Timeout | None | Local-only access |
| Backup Retention | 1 version | Minimal exposure |

# 8. INFRASTRUCTURE

## 8.1 DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT

The Simple To-Do List App is designed for local deployment on user workstations, requiring minimal infrastructure.

| Environment Type | Description | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local Machine | User's personal computer | - Python 3.6+<br>- Read/write access to home directory<br>- Terminal/Command Prompt<br>- 50MB available memory |
| Development | Developer workstation | - Python 3.6+<br>- Git<br>- Text editor/IDE<br>- Testing tools |
| Testing | Automated test environment | - Python 3.6+<br>- pytest framework<br>- CI runner |

flowchart TD
    subgraph Local["Local Environment"]
        A[Python Runtime] --> B[Application Code]
        B --> C[Local Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph Dev["Development Environment"]
        D[Source Control] --> E[Development Tools]
        E --> F[Local Testing]
    end
    
    subgraph Test["Test Environment"]
        G[Automated Tests] --> H[Test Reports]
    end
```

## 8.2 CLOUD SERVICES

*Not applicable for this implementation as the application is designed for local deployment only.*

Justification for excluding cloud services:

- Simple local file storage requirements
- No multi-user functionality
- No network connectivity needs
- Cost efficiency for end users
- Data privacy considerations

## 8.3 CONTAINERIZATION

While containerization is not required for end-user deployment, development and testing environments can benefit from containerized setups.

### Development Container Specification

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.6-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

| Component | Purpose | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base Image | Minimal Python runtime | python:3.6-slim |
| Working Directory | Application files | /app |
| Dependencies | Python packages | requirements.txt |
| Source Code | Application code | Local mount |
| Persistence | Task data storage | Volume mount |

## 8.4 ORCHESTRATION

*Not applicable for this implementation due to:*

- Single-container application
- Local deployment model
- No scaling requirements
- No service discovery needs
- No load balancing requirements
